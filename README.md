# Dataset Analyzer

Steps to run:
1. Create a python environment with `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the python environment. (linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`)
3. Run the help command to understand what is going on (`python src/main.py -h`)

Loading in data:
1. Download `Tab 3` and place it in the data folder. Rename it to `tab3.csv`
2. Download your section of datasets analyzed (I copied the data from my columns, asked GPT to convert it to CSV and removed the (TPAMI) section, as the header must be Dataset,Period,Citation Sum,Done?).
3. Place the data into the data folder and name it `datasets.csv`
